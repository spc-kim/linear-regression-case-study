Overview
Build a Linear Regression Model
You are provided with a dataset here.

Build a linear regression model that identifies the key drivers of interest rate for individual loans. Perform exploratory data analysis of the relationship between the features and relationship of the features with the response. Select your features and appropriate transformations and use statsmodels or sklearn to build a linear regression model.

You do not have to use all the variables. Focus on building the simplest model that explains interest rate. Justify the features you have or have not included in your model.

Deliverable: Data Science Results Briefing
Tomorrow afternoon your team will present a concise, results-focused briefing to the class. Your presentation should be structured like a professional data science update prepared for decision-makers evaluating loan options. Your audience consists of new business owners seeking funding and trying to understand which loan products offer the most favorable terms.

Reasonable things to include in your presentation:

1. Project Objective
Clearly state the purpose of your analysis:

What business question were you trying to answer?
What patterns or drivers of loan interest rates were you investigating?
Why does this question matter to business owners applying for loans?
2. Data Overview
Provide a clear, high-level summary of the dataset:

Which variables were most relevant to understanding loan rates or predicting loan outcomes?
3. Exploratory Insights
Show the key findings that emerged during your exploratory analysis:

Which features showed the strongest relationships or predictive potential?
Visualizations should highlight meaningful relationships, patterns, or trends.
4. Modeling Approach
Summarize the steps your modeling approach:

Which features ended up being most influential in the model's predictions?
How well did the model perform (use intuitive metrics or visuals)?
5. Key Results and Recommendations
End with a clear, decision-oriented summary:

What practical guidance could you give new business owners based on your results?
This section should be the centerpiece of the presentation.
